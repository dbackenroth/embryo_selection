So let's try to make this concrete. Let's start with the simplest case of two diseases. In the attached, section 7, I described an algorithm to generate two PRSs for two diseases and simulate the disease status. Note that these are "scaled" PRSs in terms of the overleaf document. In Eq. (57) (in overleaf) we have the formula for the risk of disease 2. Would you be interested in doing some simulations? I.e., draw (scaled) PRSs for the two diseases. Then use Eq. (57) to compute the risk of disease 2, and compare to the naive formula when considering disease 2 alone - I think something like 1 - Phi[ (t-tilde{ps}) / sqrt(1-R^2) ], where t=z_K, the upper K-quantile for a standard normal (K is the prevalence). We can make various assumptions regarding rho and the SNP-based heritability and see how they affect the risk. It would also be nice to verify that the simulated risk is always equal to the prevalence.

If the difference can be large, we'll expand the derivations to more than 2 diseases, and always use the expressions that model the dependence. In that case we'll focus on simulations alone when looking at embryo/pre-dating screening under various strategies. If the difference is always small, the first thing we should do is see how far we can get analytically.
